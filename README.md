## Inspiration
Generally, people with depression feel unmotivated to do things they want to do. Many of the anti-depressants on the market today decrease their symptoms enough so that they can form healthy, productive habits and keep them when they stop taking them. We built this bot to encourage their productivity, and hopefully take them off of anti-depressants faster.

## What it does
The bot will ask the user what skills they would want to learn. As of now, we only have three different categories: music, cooking, and art. From these categories, the users will be able to choose more specific areas such as piano, Asian food, or painting. The bot will then send the user a list of different tutorial links for the skill they have chosen. The goal is to place the tools the user needs to be productive in their hands.

## How we built it
We built this bot using the Messenger API and it functions on a Python/Flask backend. It is hosted on Heroku web service. We also used Postman to test different aspects of our code.

## Challenges we ran into
This is the first hackathon for the both of us, and this is the first time either of us has used the Messenger API. Our inexperience caused us a lot of problems. For about half of the event, we struggled to get the bot to recognize and answer our messages. After, we struggled to implement the different kinds of messages that the bot can send and receive. However, the people here have been extremely helpful, so we managed to complete the challenge that we set for ourselves.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are really proud of learning the technology displayed in this project in under 10 hours. Half-way through, we thought that we were not going to finish, but we did!

## What we learned
We learned how to implement different aspects of the Messenger API. We also learned that persistence is the key to finishing projects.

## What's next for Motivation
We want to further improve on our project by integrating the Google API. By doing so, we can eliminate the hardcoded parameters that we have and we can allow the bot to do google searches for the user.
